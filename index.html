layout: presentation

<!--

Use presentation as layout and use the _slides folder to create a file per slide (like it now)

OR

Use raw as layout and write the presentation as markdown in the same file with:

---
layout: raw
---

(I left some markdown below so there are some slides example)
DON'T FORGET TO REMOVE THIS HTML COMMENT WHEN USING IT "RAW".
